# 2048Game
2048 is an addictive number puzzle game based on simple addition.
Every time you press a key - all tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged. 
Once the board is full and no more tiles can be combined, the game is over. However, skilled players that create a tile with a value of 2048 win. 

The project uses Python tkinter to create GUI.
